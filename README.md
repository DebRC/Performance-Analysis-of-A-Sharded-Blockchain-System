# Performance Analysis of a Live Sharded Blockchain System
This is an RnD project developed under the guidance of Prof. Vinay J. Ribeiro as a part of the course CS691, IITB.

It analyses the performance of MultiVersX, a live-sharded blockchain system to measure the network's throughput, scalability, vulnerabilities and efficiency (of cross-shard communication).
It uses the local testnet provided by MultiVersX and Python scripts (Developed from scratch) for a detailed analysis.
